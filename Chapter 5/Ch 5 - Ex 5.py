Chapter 5 Exercise 5: Pets

Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each 
dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries 
in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you 
know about each pet
