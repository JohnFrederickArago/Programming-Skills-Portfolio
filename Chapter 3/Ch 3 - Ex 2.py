Chapter 3 Exercise 2: Greetings

Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just
printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each 
message should be the same, but each message should be
personalized with the person’s name.
"""

names = ["John", "Frederick", "Arago"]
print("Hello", names[0]+"!") 
print("Hello", names[1]+"!")
print("Hello", names[2]+"!")
"""
I did the same thing I did in exercise 1 but I added string before 
and after, separating with a comma and plus sign
